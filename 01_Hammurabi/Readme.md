## Hammurabi
Implementation of the Hammurabi text game

Classes:
- GameController: contains the basic logic for managing the game;
- City: stores data about the city. Also implements calculations of numerical parameters
- Ð¡svReader: reads a csv file containing the saved data.

Additional files:
- save.csv: checkpoint example;
- Main.cpp: game start;
- Readme.md: this file.

Below you can see the output of the game. To save space, I give only 8-10 rounds.
